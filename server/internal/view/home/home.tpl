        <code>present-me</code> is an experiment to try to give the author of a
        Pull Request a better way to convey why a changeset looks the way that
        it does, and how the folks reading and reviewing it should approach it.

        <code>present-me</code> uses a PR review's comments (and their
        respective diff) to create slideshow-like presentation, in the order
        that the comments are desired to appear, and only the diffs that are
        annotated with comments, leaving all other changes out of mind.
