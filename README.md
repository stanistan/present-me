# present-me

> A tool to view/show a PR as a presentation / slide-show.

See https://prme.stanistan.com for a demo.

# Development

This project uses [hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) for dependency management. 

## Bootstrap

```sh
prmectl bootstrap
```

Make sure you've run this before anything else!

### `server/.env`

This assumes you have a `.env` in the server directory.

```
PORT=8080
GH_APP_ID=
GH_INSTALLATION_ID=
GH_PK_FILE=path-to-cert.pem
```

### Development

```bash
prmectl dev
```

This will start both the go server at port `8080` and
the nuxt client at port `3000`.

You can interact with both via port `8080` since the go
server will proxy directly to nuxt.

- <http://localhost:8080>

## Testing a production binary

```bash
prmectl local-prod
```

This will generate the static output from `nuxt` and run the server
in production mode (not a proxy to the nuxt dev-server).
